confluence
=
In terms of diction, confluence refers to the merging of streams into a grand river.
This embodies the objective of the confluence project. Consider any given ruby-based
web application; after a certain point, all the assets, logic, stylesheets, etc. all
become deeply intertwined with the given project. Modularity, portability, and agility
are all out the window.

Some may argue this is a consequence of the "real world" where "scalability" necessarily
implies that the code must be a clusterfuck. I humbly beg to differ. Thus confluence,
the project you have at hand might be grand and momentus like the Amazon River, but,
you should still build it from trickles, streams, and tributaries and, only in the end,
do you confluent them together to form the raging rivers of life.



== Contributing to confluence
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
